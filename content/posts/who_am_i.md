## Who I am
Hi, I hope you're having a wonderful day/night. 

I am Ghazwan Aliesh, I grew up in a small town in the southern part of Damascus, Syria and learnt how to code there.

I went through a lot and suffered the horror of the civil war, lost family members and friends in it, on this blog I will be writing what war taught me and what I would like to learn more from life.

## What Do I Stand For?
Having seen what I saw, I think the most valuable thing I've learnt is humility and compassion towards others.

My superpower is being able to appreciate things that people take for granted, I feel very fortunate every time I pick up a meal to eat as that was not always easily accessible for me, that is my real wealth in life, I have been laughed at, jokingly, by my online friends for claiming that I am rich but that's how I genuinely feel.

I have a firm believe in the individual and what they can achieve if they were supported and loved by other, no matter what race, gender, religion you're, I will try my best to make your day better.

## Work Ethics And Values
I am currently working a software engineer for RedAcre LTD, but this applies to any other job in the world.

Statistically, most people work 8hrs a day, that's one third of the day and thus almost more than the quarter of someone's lifetime, considering childhood, vacations and retierement. knowing that I always work on things I am passionate about with people I respect and love.

Realistically, pay is important, but I believe if I am working on something for the mere fact of the pay day then I won't be happy no matter how high th salary is. I try, of course, to get the best of both worlds but primarily I try to spend my working hours doing something I enjoy and it would be insulting for my employer to see their company and projects as opportinties to just get more money in my pocket.


## Hobbies And Lifestyle
I like nature, chess, computers, exercise, philosophy,  humor, books, gaming and I am big FC Barcelona fan, I am also a wannabe-novel author as I am working on one currently

Solitude for me is very valuable feeling, I love being alone or even better alone with my girlfriend Dana :).

I am agnostic on the question of existence. I live by the golden rule, my ideal society is a one where someone can be born in any condition and still have equally good life as others.
As difficult as that might be, I try to be one of the people making it more possible than impossible.

## Thank you!
Thank you for taking the time to read about me, I wish a happy day/night ahead.
